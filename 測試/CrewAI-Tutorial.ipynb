They develop\\nabilities in small steps along a bio-inspired trajectory. However,\\ndevelopmental AIs have not yet reached the abilities of young children. In\\ncontrast, mainstream approaches for creating AIs have led to valuable AI\\nsystems and impressive feats. These approaches include deep learning and\\ngenerative approaches (e.g., large language models) and manually constructed\\nsymbolic approaches. Manually constructed AIs are brittle even in circumscribed\\ndomains. Generative AIs are helpful on average, but they can make strange\\nmistakes and not notice them. They sometimes lack common sense and social\\nalignment. This position paper lays out prospects, gaps, and challenges for\\naugmenting AI mainstream approaches with developmental AI. The ambition is to\\ncreate data-rich experientially based foundation models and human-compatible,\\nresilient, and trustworthy AIs. This research aims to produce AIs that learn to\\ncommunicate, establish common ground, read critically, consider the provenance\\nof information, test hypotheses, and collaborate. A virtuous multidisciplinary\\nresearch cycle has led to developmental AIs with capabilities for multimodal\\nperception, object recognition, and manipulation. Computational models for\\nhierarchical planning, abstraction discovery, curiosity, and language\\nacquisition exist but need to be adapted to an embodied learning approach. They\\nneed to bridge competence gaps involving nonverbal communication, speech,\\nreading, and writing.
