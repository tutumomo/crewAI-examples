      "In 2024, generative AI might actually become useful for the regular, non-tech person, and we are going to see more people tinkering with a million little AI models. State-of-the-art AI models ... Here are some important current AI trends to look out for in the coming year. Reality check: more realistic expectations. Multimodal AI. Small (er) language models and open source advancements. GPU shortages and cloud costs. Model optimization is getting more accessible. Customized local models and data pipelines. More powerful virtual agents. Running AI models locally. One of the most significant changes we saw in the second half of 2023 was the arrival of open-source, fully capable small language models that can run on phones, laptops ... Contributor. Nov 1, 2023,03:43am EDT. Share to Facebook. Share to Twitter. Share to Linkedin. The Top 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Trends For 2024. Adobe Stock. It's been a year since OpenAI ... Low-Code And No-Code Software Engineering. Back in 2019, Gartner predicted that 65 percent of application development would be done with low-code/no-code tools by 2024. This may very well turn out ...\n",
