      "Features By Ryan Morrison published 27 December 2023 While 2023 was the year of AI, 2024 will be the year we use it. Comments (0) (Image credit: Aston Martin/Apple) We have just come to the end... In 2024, generative AI might actually become useful for the regular, non-tech person, and we are going to see more people tinkering with a million little AI models. State-of-the-art AI... As 2024 unfolds, we will see monumental leaps in AI capabilities, especially in areas demanding complex problem-solving fueled by quantum advancements. 4. Here are some important current AI trends to look out for in the coming year. Reality check: more realistic expectations. Multimodal AI. Small (er) language models and open source advancements. GPU shortages and cloud costs. Model optimization is getting more accessible. Customized local models and data pipelines. More powerful virtual agents. Here are the top 10 AI and machine learning trends to prepare for in 2024. 1. Multimodal AI. Multimodal AI goes beyond traditional single-mode data processing to encompass multiple input types, such as text, images and sound -- a step toward mimicking the human ability to process diverse sensory information.\n",
